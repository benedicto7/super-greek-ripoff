*Super Greek Ripoff is a spur-of-the-moment project created by a group of 4 CS students who have had close to zero experience with game development.
As such, it is janky, barely runs on poorly optimized code and most likely contains a thousand different bugs.

We also have been up all night and we are very tired and so we must now go to sleep, good bye.
